# AsyncAPI Blocks Documentation

# About the project

---

The AsyncAPI Blocks is a no-code tool that can be used to define your specifications and get a real-time preview of what your spec looks like by simply dragging and dropping different types of blocks. The inspiration behind the AsyncAPI Blocks is [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/developers) and it's guided by the ability to easily create and maintain specifications. This makes it easy for newbies to confidently jump into any sophisticated specification file and start maintaining it like a pro.
